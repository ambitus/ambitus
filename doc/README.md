# Open Source Mainframe Development - Reference Information

If you are new to either the mainframe, or open source software development, please take a look at some of this background information that may be useful to you.

- [New to the mainframe](./new_to_the_mainframe.md)
- [New to open source](./new_to_open_source.md)

There are several good sources of information for developing open source
software on the mainframe.  In addition to the news and information available from the [Open Mainframe Project](https://openmainframeproject.org/news/), you may find these resources useful:

- [Open source software licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses)
- [The Unicode organization](https://home.unicode.org/about-unicode/) - for information about text encodings and infrastructure
- [Hardware byte order (endian-ness)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness#Software) - to understand potential issues when transferring binary files to/from the mainframe

## Security

Of particular interest these days is software security in general.  Government agencies, commercial groups, and open source advocates have been working closely to define a common set of requirements and best practices for all software development, including commercial proprietary software.  Here are some useful links to start learning about modern software security.

- [Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency](https://www.cisa.gov/)
- The [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/general)
- The [Open Worldwide Application Security Project](https://owasp.org/about/)
- [Open Source Security Foundation](https://github.com/ossf) - for the latest
approaches to secure open source software
