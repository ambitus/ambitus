- Moved this meeting up by a week for logistical purposes
- Last meeting was canceled for the Thanksgiving holiday in the US
- Had lots of problems with the Zoom meeting, so Joe & Joe consulted over the
phone.
- Didn't have much of an agenda for this meeting anyhow, since people are
busy with getting work done before the year-end holidays.
- Next meeting is very close to Christmas.  Will cancel, and pick up with TSC
meetings in 2020.
