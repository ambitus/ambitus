# TSC Meeting Minutes - 10/07/2019
**Attendees:** John Mertic (chair), Tatiana Balaburkina, Joe Devlin, Joe Bostian

- John called the meeting to order
- John Explained that the Open Mainframe Project was moving to an organization where
  the current TSC was going to be replaced by a Techinical _Advisory_ Council (TAC),
	to which the TSCs of all of the child projects would report.
- Purpose and operation of the TSC:
   - Resolve technical and non-technical (e.g. governance) issues within the project
	 - Report up to the OMP TAC
	 - Be of a reasonable size
	    - Anyone can attend the TSC, only TSC members can vote
			- Sometimes the TSC will meet in private if governance issues involving
			  specific individuals is required
- We need to elect a permanent chairperson who will:
   - Create the agenda
	 - Run the meetings according to commonly accepted meeting practices
	 - Be the public face of the project
	    - Speak when requested
			- Be a press contact
			- Provide articles and quotes as needed
- Infrastrucure for this project

	    projects

**Question** - can we set up an Ambitus org at Dockerhub and post images there?
   - John: has a to-do to check into this

**Question** - are there build and test resources planned for availability soon?
  Maybe at UVA?
	 - John: there are plans to make this kind of an environment available, and
	   steps are active now to make this happen.

- Upstreaming of ported code is a priority
   - Avoid dump & run scenarios
	 - Having build & test resources available will help here
- Consider creating a digital credential/badge
- Future meetings on a 2-week cadence
   - Plan for Mondays at 10:00 AM EST
