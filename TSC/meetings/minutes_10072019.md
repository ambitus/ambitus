# TSC Meeting Minutes - 10/07/2019

**Attendees:** John Mertic (chair), Tatiana Balaburkina, Joe Devlin, Joe Bostian,
Giancarlo Frix

- John called the meeting to order
- John Explained that the Open Mainframe Project was moving to an organization where
  the current TSC was going to be replaced by a Technical _Advisory_ Council (TAC),
  to which the TSCs of all of the child projects would report.
- Purpose and operation of the TSC:
  - Resolve technical and non-technical (e.g. governance) issues within the project
  - Report up to the OMP TAC
  - Be of a reasonable size
    - Anyone can attend the TSC, only TSC members can vote
      - Sometimes the TSC will meet in private if governance issues involving
        specific individuals is required
- We need to elect a permanent chairperson who will:
  - Create the agenda
  - Run the meetings according to commonly accepted meeting practices
  - Be the public face of the project
    - Speak when requested
      - Be a press contact
      - Provide articles and quotes as needed
- Infrastructure for this project
  [x] Github
  [x] Slack channel
  [] CI/CD build environment. This is especially important for the ported code
  projects
  [x] Mailing lists
  [x] Zoom meeting (we can use the meeting that John has already setup)
  [x] Logo
  [] Registered project name (if required)

**Question** - can we set up an Ambitus org at DockerHub and post images there?

- John: has a to-do to check into this

**Question** - are there build and test resources planned for availability soon?
Maybe at VCU? - John: there are plans to make this kind of an environment available, and
steps are active now to make this happen.

- Upstreaming of ported code is a priority
  - Avoid dump & run scenarios
  - Having build & test resources available will help here
- Consider creating a digital credential/badge
- Future meetings on a 2-week cadence
  - Plan for Mondays at 10:00 AM EST
