## Agenda
- Potential for a new content
   - IBM zATT team has prototyped a test framework for source code, and promoted
     to and internal Github.  We can publish this prototype at Ambitus
   - IBM zATT team has also has a new Dockerfile and tools available to enable
     access to zCX from x/86 platforms.  This could be added to the _linux_containers_
     repo.
- Interest from an IBM customer on seeing Anaconda ported to Linux on Z
- Ongoing discussion about Rocket's solution bundle plans and potential paths to
  upstreaming porting changes

## Minutes
- (JM) Recommend getting an opinion from Steve Winslow (?) about code that the
  zATT team may be referencing or including in a Docker container, in case there
  are unfavorable license entanglements.
- (JM) Ambitus would be a great place for a customer to start up a project to do
  something like getting Anaconda to run on Linux on Z.
