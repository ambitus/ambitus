- (JB) Called the meeting to order
- (PF) Discuss Rocket/IBM alignment for base solution bundle
  - Python, Miniconda & assorted utilities (~30 packages)
  - Is a foundation for several devOPs & Zowe solutions in the works
  - A zero-cost offering with a new PID
  - SMP installable and supported through service & support contract
  - (JM) Does this affect the governance of the offering?
    - (JB) No, this is just a packaging and support mechanism
    - This is a bootstrap solution that enables Python and Anaconda to
      enable migration to the Anaconda package mechanism for open source
- (PF) Establishing a trusted Anaconda channel
  - (JB) A similar trusted channel is necessary for Docker images
  - Best solution:
    - The OMP is willing to host binary channels
    - Customers trust the OMP as a source
  - (JM) OMP would create a Limited Liability Corporation (LLC) for this
    - Could also host:
      - Zowe packages
      - Node Package Manager (NPM) packages
  - (JM) Will add a quality signoff to contribution guidelines
    - Where component/dependency images and packages are pulled from
    - DCO
    - Quality metrics from testing
    - Call-home metrics and tracking is _**not**_ allowed
  - (JB) Package vetting will be key to establishing trust with our customers
- (JB) We need to start using our contribution guidelines for making updates
  to the Project (we haven't been so far)
  - Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)
  - Licenses in prologs
  - ...
- (JM) A common practice is to include a list of adopters of our project
  - Helps establish trust for potential users, knowing others have adopted
  - (PF) Mainframe customer base will be very hesitant to do this
- (JB) Do we want to adopt 2 Factor Authentication (2FA)?
  - (JM) This is a good practice that we should enable
  - We should also enable the DCO requirement hook
- (JM) The Ambitus lifecycle document needs review by the team
