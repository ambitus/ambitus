# Contribution Guidelines

All contributions to projects under Ambitus are subject to the requirements of the Open Mainframe
Project and Linux Foundation.  Each project here has its own set of conventions, but all projects 
follow this common set of guidelines:

- All code contributed must be made under an [Apache 2 license](https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0.html), and any documentation and non-code will be received and made available by the Project under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), following the [license and copyright guidelines of the Open Mainframe Project](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/tsc/blob/master/process/contribution_guidelines.md#license-specification)
- All contributions must be accompanied by a [Developer Certification of Origin (DCO) signoff](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/tsc/blob/master/process/contribution_guidelines.md#developer-certificate-of-origin)
- Contributions must be made as a pull request, and is subject to review by a [committer](https://github.com/ambitus/ambitus/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md#committer) to be accepted.
- All projects must release code with a unique version id correlates to a set of documented changes 
so users can understand the function contained in the package.  Version IDs should follow either the 
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) or [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/) convention.
- Projects should tag their releases to make identification of finished works easier to find.
- Projects must provide a human-readable summary of major changes in each release.  These can 
be provided as release notes, CHANGELOG, NEWS, discussion group announcement, or something similar.  
The key is being in a human-readable form rather than something like raw git log output.
- Release notes for a project must list all CVEs that the release resolves.
