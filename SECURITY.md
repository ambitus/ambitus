# Security Policy
The Ambitus projects each have a security policy to enhance communications
about emerging vulnerabilities.  All projects in Ambitus have a private 
vulnerability reporting mechanism for issues discovered in the field that 
require a patch.

See ```SECURITY.md``` in the associated respository for each project for details 
about the project's supported versions.

## Supported Versions
Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.1   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
